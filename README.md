## CppProjects

This folder includes the files and projects that I completed in CS 106B: Programming Abstractions (C++).

Each project focuses on a certain aspect of programming abstraction, while requires employing other capabilities of a programming language (C++, here).

For further information on the projects, including test cases, please refer to [CS 106B: Programming Abstractions (C++) Spring 2018](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1186/).
