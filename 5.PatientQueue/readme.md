This folder contains code of implementing a waiting system for hospital. 

As each new patient checks into the hospital, the staff assesses the patientâ€™s injuries and gives them an integer priority rating. Smaller integers represent greater urgency; for example, a patient of priority 1 is more urgent and should receive care before a patient of priority 2. Once a doctor is ready to see a patient, the patient with the most urgent priority (i.e., with the lowest number rating) is seen first.
